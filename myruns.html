        <h1>Why I love running</h1>
        <p><b>I have been fortunate enough to join a fabulous women running club the ‘Croydon Running Sisters’ (CRS) where I have the opportunity to run and learn about the many woodlands in the green Croydon Borough.  Joining the CRS has been a wonderful experience in many fronts, and a great support network especially during the pandemic.  Other activities I got to do through my running club have been visits to gardens and parks.  One of these visits led me to the current gardening volunteering work that I have undertaking this year with ‘Friends of Purley Beeches’ (FoPB).</b></p>
