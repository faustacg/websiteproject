        <h1>Why I love gardening</h1>
        <p><b>Very few things in life will give you as much pleasure as growing plants from seeds.  The sense of gratification and joy experienced when watching the first green shoots showing up is truly especial. This is my first ever attempt to successfully grow canna plants from seeds.  The seeds came from St James’ Park in London, and not only I managed to grow 9 plants from 9 seeds but also this year I had the delight of seeing them flower as you can see in the background picture of my ‘Why I love gardening’ section of my first ever webpage design.</b></p>
