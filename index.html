        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p><b>I am technologically minded, and have had the opportunity of working collaboratively with developers as part of an agile delivery team in government. I saw with interest their work, and when the opportunity of attending the coding course arose, I expressed an interest, and the rest is history.
            I have thoroughly enjoyed myself, have passed on my feedback to my tutor and course organisers, as well as my work coach at the Job Centre. Undertaking the coding course has been an invaluable, and hands-on experience that enabled me to draw from, to answer questions and use examples of the learnings picked at my recent ‘Associate Agile Delivery Manager interview’.</b></p>
